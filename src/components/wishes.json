Bcs yknow this website is currently in a development stage so you gotta test here and there yaknow what im sayin. Yea life as a dev. Pretty boring... Im just tryna make this long so that i can cater the CSS to be responsive. Im pretty sure most of her friends use a phone to get on this website so yea i need to make this website responsive. Yea yea i could use bootstrap and what not but where's the fun?!??!?! I need to challenge myself by making everything from scratch to be better. Life is not all about having shortcuts. You need to know the hard life before you can have an easy life. That's if you want to have an easy life consistently in the future la. Omg this is pretty long. I know i can be a bit philosophical but im just rambling. Ok stop it ammar this is enough i guess. I mean i could use lorem ipsum but nyeh. From scratch kan.. Ambik kau. HahAhAHhahAHa wtf ammar cringe bodo. Okok move on this is good enough... I guess? Let's see.",

I just want to say that I am so extremely grateful that you decided to talk to me in Form 3 and ask to be my desk mate because that decision that you made is why I am so blessed to be able to call you my best friend today. You are so beautiful, kind, loving, nurturing, funny, bubbly, strong, resilient, selfless, brave, confident and the list could go on and on because there is just so much to love about you and to know you is to love you, Shaheera.You've helped me through some of the darkest days of my life and without you and your love, I really would not have been able to have gotten through those days. Thank you for being so patient with me and for never getting tired of reassuring and comforting me whenever I need you. You mean the world to me and you deserve good things and I sincerely pray that Allah swt blesses you not only with good health, love, happiness, good health and success but I also hope He gives you all that your heart desires and more to fulfil you in this life and also the next. Crossing paths with you when we were 15 was probably one of the best gifts Allah has ever given me because not only has it given me the privilege of being a part of your life and knowing you but also the privilege to grow with you, laugh with you, cry with you and the blessing of a companion to get through life's many ups and downs with. We literally grew up together and I really wouldn't have it any other way. Thank you for being you, Shaheera, I sincerely believe that you are a gift to everyone whose lives you are in. Happy Birthday once again Shachem/Shaheera Zidan (hehe) I hope you have an amazing day today ‚ô•Ô∏è",

I hope you know that I'm always here for you no matter what, I'm so immensely thankful for our friendship although we don't speak very often but your occasional texts and super entertaining stories on instagram are reminders of what a wonderful person you are. I hope you have a great birthday, I'm celebrating with you in spirit! :)",
