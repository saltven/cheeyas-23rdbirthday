                        <p>Leo, 10th House</p>
                        <p>The sun determines your ego, identity, and "role" in life. It's the core of who you are, 
    and is the sign you're most likely to already know. Your Sun is in Leo, meaning you are 
    fundamentally bold and proud. You love attention and to be cared for. You pay it back in 
    kind with your charm and your ability to make people feel better when they're blue. You 
    know what your skills are and how to use them. It's in your tenth house, meaning you feel 
    the need to distinguish yourself from others through goals, success, and responsibility.</p>

                        <p>Scorpio, 3rd House</p>
                        <p>The moon rules your emotions, moods, and feelings. This is likely the sign you most think of yourself as, since it reflects your personality when you're alone or deeply comfortable. Your Moon is in Capricorn, meaning your emotional self is somewhat repressed in the name of responsibility, seriousness, and rationality. You crave the guidance and comfort of a teacher or parent. It's in your third house, meaning you find security and safety through the things you know and are familiar with.</p>

                        <p>Ascendant</p>
                        <p>Capricon, 1st House</p>
                        <p>Your ascendant is the "mask" you present to people. It can be seen in your personal style 
and how you come off to people when you first meet. Some say it becomes less relevant as 
you get older. It changes every two hours, so if it doesn't make sense, text your mom to 
confirm your birth time. Your Ascendant is in Scorpio, meaning you come across as 
passionate, incisive, cunning, strategic, and perceptive. Your intense and tenacious 
drive comes off as intimidating and powerful if not malicious or aggressive.</p>
